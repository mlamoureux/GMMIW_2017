    "Fowler suggests a model to explain how traffic jams form. Specifically, we observe sometimes that traffic on a road slows to a crawl, with many cars packed together. It creeps along from a while, then the road clears and we rapidly go back to travelling at the speed limit. This is a weird phenomena -- there was nothing on the road to block the traffic, it just seemed to cluster up and slow down. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a simplified model, we do a continuous approximation. Imagine a straight length of road, with cars distributed on along the road. We define a function $\\rho = \\rho(x,t)$ to be the density of cars (say number of cars per meter of roadway -- this could be a fractional number), which varies with both position $x$ along the road, and time $t$. We assume all the cars at some point are moving with roughly the same velocity, which we denote by $v = v(x,t)$, a function that varies with both position and time. The flux $q=q(x,t)$ is the number of cars per second that pass through the point $x$ on the roadway, which can vary with the time $t$. Of course we have that flux is just the density times velocity, so\n",

While if $\\rho < 1/2, \\rho_x >0$, the density will be decreasing with time. This will tend to form a \"shock wave\" in the density of cars. That is, if there is a point on the road where the density passes from below 1/2 to above 1/2, the density before that point decreases, while the density after that point increases. This continues until you get the sharp shock wave. You car sees this as a transition into a very dense, slow moving region of cars, following by the clearing out of the road as you move into the rarified region after the shock. \n",

    "\n",
    "I've uploaded a few examples of industrial math modeling reports. Some are better than others, so take a look at the samples (and others online) to get an idea of what appeals to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's stress that the basic structure of the report is this:\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "2. Main Body\n",
    "3. Conclusion\n",
    "4. Acknowledgements\n",
    "5. References\n",
    "\n",
    "where the _Intro_ and _Conclusion_ are written in non-technical language, that a non-expert should be able to understand. Think of this as something your parents or siblings will read, and so you should use ordinary language that outlines what the report is about, and what overall conclusions you reach. By \"ordinary language\" I don't mean to be overly casual, or sloppy, or elementary. Just still to proper English, stay away from equations and technical jargon, and write how you imagine a good researcher would write in a way that will interest and entice you and your colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the _Acknowledgements_ are important -- in addition to thanking anyone who helped out, you often must acknowledge financial support from any grants or companies that helped you out, or even the use of specialized data from somewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "_References_ -- important. Rather than doing this __last__ in your work, keep track from the beginning of the project all the books and research articles that you work from as you do the project. You can easily grab BibTex entries from MathSciNet if you don't like typing all that info. Stick it all in a file, and then when you are writing your report, all the references are there and ready to use. (And will be properly formatted by BibTex.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the important stuff. \n",
    "\n",
    "The __Main Body__ is where the deep content of the report goes. Industrial math problem reports are different than a pure math paper, where the goal in pure math is usually to present a theorem and proof (along with supporting theory, definitions, lemmas, and so forth). For these applied problems, you must start with a specific problem, find a way (or many ways) to approach the problem mathematically, then use your math to solve the problem in some tangible way. Using real data is important (although sometimes we start with simulated data to rapidly test ideas), using real, accurage computation is also important. And it is very important that somehow you link the mathematical results back to the original problem, and ideally give a concrete answer to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections in the Main Body might go like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Body\n",
    "- description of the industrial problem and its relevants to a real industy\n",
    "- a reformulation of the problem in terms of physical processes, statistical models, dynamical models, etc\n",
    "- translation of the physics or statistics into a concrete mathematical model (given time, one might consider several different models) This will include equations, information about data, initial conditions, boundary conditions, etc. \n",
    "- Non-dimensionalizing and/or simplifying the model\n",
    "- mathematical analysis of the model (could include asymptitics) or applying computational methods\n",
    "- applying the analysis/computation to real data\n",
    "- translating the mathematical results into something relevant to the original industrial problem. Ideally, solving the original question that arose in the industrial problem\n",
    "- discussion of the limitations of the model and its applicabilty\n",
    "- perhaps some suggestions for future work. \n",

    "- 1.1 A design for a magnetized target fusion reactor. He discuss in detail the industrial problem, which is to build a fusion reactor using a sphere of molten lead surrounding a core of hydrogen fuel, to compress the core to the point of fusion. This follows a specific reactor design of the company  General Fusion. The key goal here is to estimate the minimum size of the hydrogen core under compression, which is considered a key parameter indicating the efficiency of the reactor. \n",

    "- 1.2 Discusses the physical model\n",

    "\n",
    "- 3.. The formal asymptotic analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "- 4.. Comparision of the analysis with numerical results, using real data. He points out the correspondance between what his new asymptotc analysis has to say about the minimum radius of the core, compared to the numerical results from an earlier, computational paper. (This answers teh original problem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4.6 Discusses the limitations of the model, and even points out some weaknesses in the basic reactor design (e.g. very little energy actually is transfered from the lead ball to the hydrogen core). \n",

    "- 5.. Conclusions and future work (Maybe not the order I would recommend, but okay)\n",
